Mar 27 13:46:59.000 [notice] Bridge 'oberlol' has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.  Will prefer using its IPv4 address (45.142.181.131:42069) based on the configured Bridge address.
Mar 27 13:46:59.000 [notice] new bridge descriptor 'oberlol' (fresh): $6EBCF6B02DA2B982F4080A7119D737366AFB74FA~oberlol [6cAldHqZh+CQV+mGJqs8oPXL3vu4apZpU+jqjIo3bWo] at 45.142.181.131 and [2a07:6d40:2:2a00:0:fb:0:1]

Mar 27 13:47:01.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.

Mar 27 13:47:01.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.
Mar 27 13:47:01.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 45% (requesting_descriptors): Asking for relay descriptors
Mar 27 13:47:01.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8889, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 100% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
Mar 27 13:47:01.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 50% (loading_descriptors): Loading relay descriptors
Mar 27 13:47:01.000 [notice] The current consensus contains exit nodes. Tor can build exit and internal paths.
