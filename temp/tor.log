Jun 19 12:22:19.240 [notice] We compiled with OpenSSL 300000d0: OpenSSL 3.0.13 30 Jan 2024 and we are running with OpenSSL 300000d0: 3.0.13. These two versions should be binary compatible.

Jun 19 12:22:19.242 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.

Jun 19 12:22:22.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.
Jun 19 12:22:22.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 45% (requesting_descriptors): Asking for relay descriptors
Jun 19 12:22:22.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8685, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 100% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
