Apr 24 00:50:13.314 [notice] We compiled with OpenSSL 300000d0: OpenSSL 3.0.13 30 Jan 2024 and we are running with OpenSSL 300000d0: 3.0.13. These two versions should be binary compatible.
Apr 24 00:50:13.316 [notice] Tor 0.4.8.10 running on Linux with Libevent 2.1.12-stable, OpenSSL 3.0.13, Zlib 1.3, Liblzma 5.4.5, Libzstd 1.5.5 and Glibc 2.39 as libc.

Apr 24 00:50:13.316 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.

Apr 24 00:50:17.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.

Apr 24 00:50:17.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8774, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 100% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
