Apr 09 13:20:34.000 [notice] Bridge 'HonneyBadger' has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.  Will prefer using its IPv4 address (67.205.142.190:9889) based on the configured Bridge address.

Apr 09 13:20:35.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.

Apr 09 13:20:35.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.

Apr 09 13:20:35.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8834, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 100% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
