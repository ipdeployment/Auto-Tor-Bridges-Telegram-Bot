Jun 09 12:22:19.036 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.

Jun 09 12:22:20.000 [notice] Bridge 'ForPrivacyNETbr27' has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.  Will prefer using its IPv4 address (185.177.207.218:11218) based on the configured Bridge address.

Jun 09 12:22:22.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.

Jun 09 12:22:22.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8652, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 100% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
