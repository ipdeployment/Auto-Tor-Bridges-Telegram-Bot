Apr 12 05:39:50.150 [notice] We compiled with OpenSSL 300000d0: OpenSSL 3.0.13 30 Jan 2024 and we are running with OpenSSL 300000d0: 3.0.13. These two versions should be binary compatible.
Apr 12 05:39:50.152 [notice] Tor 0.4.8.10 running on Linux with Libevent 2.1.12-stable, OpenSSL 3.0.13, Zlib 1.3, Liblzma 5.4.5, Libzstd 1.5.5 and Glibc 2.39 as libc.

Apr 12 05:39:50.152 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.

Apr 12 05:39:51.000 [notice] Bridge 'OhNoAnotherBridge8' has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.  Will prefer using its IPv4 address (185.85.87.222:80) based on the configured Bridge address.

Apr 12 05:39:53.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.

Apr 12 05:39:53.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8774, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 100% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
