Apr 05 13:02:17.000 [notice] Bridge 'Unnamed' has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.  Will prefer using its IPv4 address (208.109.214.243:443) based on the configured Bridge address.
Apr 05 13:02:17.000 [notice] new bridge descriptor 'Unnamed' (fresh): $8A7322A463C051DB6DC35B1159F119FC3373BB06~Unnamed [MLJ+FS1hHTEcaTBLxJ6/NEW4sIvYTNT9p9M4TsHfj/U] at 208.109.214.243 and [2603:3:6102:f8d0::]

Apr 05 13:02:18.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.

Apr 05 13:02:18.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.

Apr 05 13:02:18.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8824, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 100% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)

Apr 05 13:02:18.000 [notice] The current consensus contains exit nodes. Tor can build exit and internal paths.
